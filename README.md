# Deep Learning Lab

Welcome to **Deep Learning Lab**, a collection of hands-on deep learning programs designed to help you master core concepts and architectures — from scratch to state-of-the-art.

## What's Inside

- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- DNN (Deep Neural Networks)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)

Each implementation is built for clarity, visualization, and reusability — perfect for learners, interview prep, and workflow optimization.
